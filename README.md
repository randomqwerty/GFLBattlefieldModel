# GFLBattlefieldModel

Initial translation of lins1122's [battlefield model spreadsheet](https://gall.dcinside.com/mgallery/board/view/?id=micateam&no=1353151) for Girls' Frontline. Can be used to visualize enemy formations/movement and to some extent, skill ranges. May be buggy due to issues with Korean characters and VBA.
